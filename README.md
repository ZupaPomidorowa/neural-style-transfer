# Neural style transfer
This repository contains code for individual project for studies, which aim is change image style with preservation content. Project consisted of 4 parts:
1. Classification with datasets: MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100
2. Familiarity with CycleGAN network
3. Creating neural networks for neural style transfer
4. Creating app with PyQT and trained neural style transfer model
